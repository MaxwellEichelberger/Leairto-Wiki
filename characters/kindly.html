            <p>Kindly is a core member of The Marked Couriers. 
                He is a former Student of the Erison School for Arcane Study, but was overall a bully when he was there and tried to be a cool guy, even if he is truly smart.
                He is usually trying to impress any lady he comes across, especially Selena.</p>

            <h2>Backstory</h2>
                <p>Growing up, Kindly was a student at the Erison School for Arcane Study, alongside Kolvair, who he had given the nickname "Norm", and Garrick, where his father is trhe current headmaster. 
                    Overall, when he was there, he was a bully to some of the other students, especially Norm, to try and appear like a "cool" "popular" guy. 
                    This is also why he took up learning Skateboard Tricks.</p>
                <p>Despite this outward expression, Kindly is very intelligent. 
                    In another act of rebellion, he decided to study one of the hardest and banned schools of magic, Chronurgy.
                    When his father found this out, they engaged in a fight that led Kindly to leave the school to go travel the world. 
                    In desperate need for money, he took the job for S.I.S.</p>

            <h4>Arcane Recovery</h4>
                <p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. 
                    Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover.
                    The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>
                <p>For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. 
                    You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>
            <h4>Chronal Shift</h4>
                <p>At 2nd level, you can magically exert limited control over the flow of time around a creature. 
                    As a reaction, after you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can force the creature to reroll. 
                    You make this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. 
                    The target must use the result of the second roll.</p>
                    <p>You can use this ability twice, and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h4>Temporal Awareness</h4>
                <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can add your Intelligence modifiers to your initiative rolls.</p>
