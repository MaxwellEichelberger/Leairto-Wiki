            <h2></h2>
                <p>The party meets with the person that hired them, an Occult Researcher/Wizard Itaren, as he explains the mission and offers 100 gold for its completion.
                    As they enter, Annika and Kaccir hear a voice in their heads sating "Leave My Domain".
                    They soon enter the forest a follow a small trail until it leads to a much larger, more established one.
                    Soon after, they see a man with a giant hole in their chest laying on the ground wearing green armor.
                    He says that he is a part of the Ranger Brigade, and while he was out on patrol, he got attacked by a monster "with many arms and a jaw the size of a tree" and told the party to check a nearby cabin before he took his last breath and dying.</p>
                <p>As the party arrived outside of the cabin, they see it has its roof ripped off and holes all through the walls.
                    When they walk in, they see a set dinner table with a family of corpses sitting around it, all with the same holes in their chests. 
                    Blaize decides to look out the back window and sees two tentacles fade into the darkness as the entire party hears "Leave My Domain" as the corpses start coming to life and attack the party.
                    The party defeats the zombie family of four and venture further down the path.</p>
                <p>As they leave the house, more and more corpse litter the sides of path, all with giant holes in their chests.
                    Before long, Grimm gets grabbed up by one of these tentacle, which are revelaed to be vines, as they start fighting the beast head on.
                    After damaging its vines, the full beast comes into view, with a large circular body made of plants with many vines coming out of its body and giant jaw with sharp teeth.
                    Amongst the chaos, Kairiel reveals his angelic form as Annika thinks he is a god.
                    During this fight, the monster opens its mouth open wider and reveals the decapitated head of a druid controlling the beast from inside.
                    It talks to the party before it starts casting spells alongside the beast, giving it a tougher skin and healing some of its wounds.
                    In battle, the party notices the creature's pine is made of a giant finger.</p>
                <p>As they slay the beast, its body falls apart, except for the giant finger and the Druid's head.
                    While walking back, the Druid mutters "Protus, I wish for my body back so I may protect my Domain" before Blaize punts him back into forest.
                    When they arrive back to Itaren, they give him the finger as he divulges how this is an artifact that comes from a fallen god that gives twisted wishes to those who pray to Protus with it.
                    He then tells the party to go back to the forest and retreive the head for an extra 50 gold.</p>
                <p> 5 minutes after the party returns to the forest, where the Druid had its head grafted back onto its body devoid of bones and ambushes the party.
                    As it tries to entrap Grimm within its skin prison, the party finally deafeats him and returns the head back to Itaren for good.
                    He thanks the party for all the good work as he gives them the extra 50 gold, and he takes the Finger and the head back to his manor for study</p>
